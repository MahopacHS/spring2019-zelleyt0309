The expression says **number when divided by 2 has a reminder (%) equal to (==) zero**. The key to deciphering this is knowing how the `%` and `==` operators work. Understanding the basics, such as these, areessential to problem solving with programming, for once you understand the basics programming becomes an exercise in assembling them together into a workable solution.\n\nThe `if` statement evaluates this Boolean expression and when the expression is `True`, Python executes all of the code indented underneath the `if`.
