How many times must you execute this program and check the output before you can be reasonably assured your code is correct? Explain.\n12 times to get each letter, put a noninteger, a negative, and a letter for the inputs\n3. When testing this program do you think its more important to test numbers in the middle of the grade range or exactly on the boundary between one grade range and the next. Justify your response.\nI think it's more important to test the ones right next to it to make sure that you didn'y accidently put the equal sign in the wrong spot"
