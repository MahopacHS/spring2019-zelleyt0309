Modify the program to print `that is not a paint quality` and then exit in those cases.\nI was unsure of how to exit so I looked it up and used \"raise SystemExit\" which force quits the program\n2. What happens when you enter something other than `'y'` or `'n'` for color matching? Re-write the program to print `you must enter y or n` whenever you enter something other than those two values.\n3. Why can't we use Python's `try...except` in this example?\nwe can't use the try...except in this example because that will stop the program if there is an error at any point while we only want to quit it if the user inputs an invalid type of paint quality\n4. How many times (at minimum) must we execute this program and check the results before we can be reasonably assured it is correct?\nI would do it 9 times"
