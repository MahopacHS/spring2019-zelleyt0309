The code indented beneath it (lines 3-4) will repeat, in a linear fashion until the Boolean expression on line 2 `i <= 3` is `False`, at which time the program continues with line 5.\n\n### Some Terminology\n\nWe call `i <=3` the loop's **exit condition**. The variable `i` inside the exit condition is the only thing that we can change to make the exit condition `False`, therefore it is the **loop control variable**. On line 4 we change the loop control variable by adding one to it, this is called an **increment**.\n\nFurthermore, we know how many times this loop will execute before it actually runs: 3. Even if we allowed the user to enter a number, and looped that many times, we would still know. We call this a **definite loop**. Whenever we iterate over a fixed number of values, regardless of whether those values are determined at run-time or not, we're using a definite loop.\n\nIf the loop control variable never forces the exit condition to be `False`, we have an **infinite loop**. As the name implies, an Infinite loop never ends and typically causes our computer to crash or lock up.   "

This is typically based on user action, and therefore our loop is subject to the whims of whoever interacts with it. Most applications like spreadsheets, photo editors, and games use indefinite loops. They'll run on your computer, seemingly forever, until you choose to quit the application.  \n\nThe classic indefinite loop pattern involves getting input from the user inside the loop. We then inspect the input and based on that input we might exit the loop. Here's an example:"

For example we need to set `name = \"\"` in line 1 so that line 2 start out as `True`. Also we have this wonky logic where when we say `'mike'` it still prints `Nope, my name is not mike!` before exiting.\n\n### Break statement\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use the break statement. **break** tells Python to exit the loop immediately. We then re-structure all of our indefinite loops to look like this:\n\n```\nwhile True:\n    if exit-condition:\n        break\n```\n\nHere's our program we-written with the break statement.
