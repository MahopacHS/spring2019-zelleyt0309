This has a variety of applications the most common being buiding an email list.\nThe best way to find the emails in the mailbox file is to search for lines in the file that begin with \"From: (similar to what we did in the lab). When you find an email write just the email address (not \"From:\" and the address) to \"NYC4-emails.txt\", and don't worry about duplicates.\n\nThe program should print the number of emails it wrote to the file.\n\nExample Run:\n\n```\nWrote 27 emails to NYC4-emails.txt\n```"
