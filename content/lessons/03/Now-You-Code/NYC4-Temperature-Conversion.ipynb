Is this an error?\nbecause you can convert negative temperatures too, this is correct\n2. Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain.\nIdk it would probably be the same amount of work\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why?\nI did, it makes it easier because it allows you to create the value first and then print it out"
