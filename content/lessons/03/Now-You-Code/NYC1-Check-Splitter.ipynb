What type of error is this? Do you think it can be handled in code?\nidk it stopped letting me run the program, but probably a syntax error\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? Does the program run? Does it make sense? \nthe program runs, but it doubles the check because that's how math works"
