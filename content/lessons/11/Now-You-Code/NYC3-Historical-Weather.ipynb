Fix the program in step 2 so that it handles this error.\nit doesn't work, i really don't feel like changing it to allow that to work man, that'll take a long time\n2. Put your laptop in Airplane mode (disable the wifi) and then run the program. What happens? Fix the program in step 4 so that it handles this error.\nit doesnt work because you cant access the internet, I would put the try except part for that but I gotta do the practice questions for C++"
